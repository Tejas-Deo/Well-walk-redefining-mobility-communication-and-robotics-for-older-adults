# Well-walk: redefining mobility, communication, and robotics for older adults

## Product Vision
A growing number of the elderly encounter difficulty in performing daily tasks and feel isolated as they become disconnected from friends and family. These problems are exacerbated during times of pandemic when 
face-to-face visits from caretakers of all kinds are curtailed. Home robots have been proposed to address these problems but are not yet proving effective. Reviewing the available resources in the market reveals that older
adults’ options are not only limited but in many ways frustrating. Complicated user interfaces, combined with the reluctance of the elderly to embrace new technologies, make for potential solutions that never really
serve their intended targets. While technology has advanced significantly in recent years, many older adults struggle to adopt new technologies due to complex interfaces and unfamiliar user experiences. The team hypothe-
sizes that developing familiar technology, such as video conferencing and entertainment, within a simplified user interface integrated into a walker with a semi-autonomous modular kit, will provide benefits to the user 
and enable greater adoption of new technologies— especially in the years to come.

This repository demonstrates the working of the semi-autonomous system and the user interface.
